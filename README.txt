Using the forgotten realms wikia and my limited computer science knowledge and skills(w.i.p.), 
and opexams.com's ai question generator, I am building an Anki deck for Forgotten Realms lore.

This has been a dream of mine since I was a boy (not that long ago) but the amount of work involved
in parsing all the info into questions by myself was daunting.

We have AI now. And it actually does a good job.

I'm focused primarily on lore, but if anyone expresses interest in the various editions' stats and what not,
or wants to contribute that themselves, I'm open to it.

I will be working on this deck and uploading periodically. Free to download for anyone that's interested.

If you want to contribute, you can generate questions and answers either as a csv, or a fully-developed anki deck.
Don't forget that anki allows you import csv files into decks and it'll split it into individual cards.
Always select UTF-8 and comma for the field separator.


You can also manually step through a wikia article yourself and make the questions and answers by hand- I don't recommend it, but
all help is appreciated.

I am still learning how to use github, but you can request a merge or commit or pull
or whatever it's called.

I look forward to filling up the deck. The scope of the project is already quite sizable.

I know this shit reeks of newb, but I'm learning- if you've got ANY feedback or advice, on ANYTHING, 
use my username (largeCHUBZ) in the subject field, and make sure you call me a bitch "largeCHUBZ, you bitch!" email: shawnpd101@gmail.com 

peace out,
